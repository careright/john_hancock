# JohnHancock
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Brantron/john_hancock.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/Brantron/john_hancock)

Saving signatures has never been easier!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'john_hancock'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install john_hancock

## Setup (< Rails 7)

With the gem installed, simply include it in the relevant JS manifest

```javascript
//= require john_hancock
```

## Setup (Rails 7 and above using Import Maps)

1. In config/initializers/assets.rb add:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.assets.precompile += %w(john_hancock.js)
```

2. In config/importmap.rb add:

```ruby
pin "john_hancock", to: 'john_hancock.js', preload: true
```

3. Lastly, in app/javascript/application.js:

```javascript
import "john_hancock"
```

## Usage

Then you are free to use it in the view

```erb
<%= form_for @user do |f| %>
  <%= f.signature_field :signature %>
  <%= f.submit %>
<% end %>
```

Once this is saved, you can output the string as an image.

```erb
<%= image_tag @user.signature %>
```

The signature_field method generates a canvas as well as a hidden field. If you would like more flexibility in the placement of these elements you can use them separately.

```erb
<%= form_for @user do |f| %>
  <%= f.signature_canvas %>
  <p>some text about the form</p>
  <%= f.hidden_signature_field :signature %>
  <%= f.submit %>
<% end %>

```
